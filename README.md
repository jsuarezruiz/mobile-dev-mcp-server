# Mobile Development MCP

**Control mobile devices with AI through the Model Context Protocol!**

This is a MCP designed to manage and interact with mobile devices and simulators. It provides utilities for tasks such as app installation, device management, and log retrieval for iOS and Android development environments.

### Features
- **Device Management**: Boot, shutdown, or list connected devices and simulators.
- **Application Management**: Install, launch, or manage applications on target devices.
- **Visual Diagnostics**: Take screenshots of the devices and simulators screen.
- **File Management**: Seamlessly push files to or pull files from connected devices.
- **UI Automation**: Interact with the device through taps, swipes, text input.
- **Log Management**: Retrieve log files and system information from connected devices.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Supports both Android and iOS environments.

### Prerequisites

To use this server, ensure the following tools are installed on your development machine:

- ADB (Android Debug Bridge) for Android device management.
- Xcode Command Line Tools for iOS simulator management (xcrun simctl).
- Facebook [IDB](https://fbidb.io/) tool [(see install guide)](https://fbidb.io/docs/installation) (Only required for UI Automation on iOS).
- .NET SDK (e.g., .NET 9)

### Setup
1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Build the project: `dotnet build`
4. Configure with VS Code or other client:
